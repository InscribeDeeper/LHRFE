Introduction

The website is designed to make a platform to list second-hand furniture and rent lease sublets. Users can visit the website to find their desired products at a much cheaper price and the best place to live for pursuing their education or career future. Also, users can post their unwanted goods for extra gain and sublets an apartment.

There is a potential market among students to handle used products and sublet apartments. Due to the pandemic, many students need to sublet their rents and sell their used goods. We want a website to make it easier for students to sell their goods for convenience.
On the website, a secure environment is going to be provided for users to feed themselves with timely and accurate information and post goods’ information with no worry.
